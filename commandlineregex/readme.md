# Command line and regex

This folder contains links related to the week on command line and regex.

## Command line

You will [find resources on command line in my dedicated repository here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/commandline)

The [exercise on using grep for a CSV and for HTML pages is here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/commandline/blob/master/grep.md)

Key commands are listed below. Although Windows PowerShell alternatives are given, you can also [download Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) which will allow you to use the Mac/Linux-based commands (which are generally simpler) on a Windows machine:

* `pwd`
* `cd`
* `ls` (Mac/Linux) or `dir` (PC)
* `mkdir` or `New-Item -Name NAMEHERE -ItemType directory` (PC)
* `rmdir` or `Remove-Item` (PC)
* `rm` or `Remove-Item` (PC)
* `man`
* `head` or `Get-Content -TotalCount 20` (PC - [see documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-content?view=powershell-5.1))
* `find` or `Get-ChildItem` (PC - look for tutorials)
* `wc` (Mac/Linux) or `Measure-Object -Line` (PC - [see documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/measure-object?view=powershell-5.1))
