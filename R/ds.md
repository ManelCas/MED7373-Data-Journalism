# Directed study

This week you've been introduced to R and RStudio. You should have a basic understanding of what it can do, and how it works. 

As you prepare for a second class on R spend at least 5 hours exploring the language. In particular:

* Go through the [10 things to do with R first](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/blob/master/R/readme.md) to get some more experience. You can use the same data we used in the class. In particular:
  * Make sure you've used `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` in your `read.csv()` function
  * Make a data frame of MPs to combine with the expenses data to try out the `cbind()` function (like VLOOKUP)
  * For SPSS data [see this notebook on election survey data](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/blob/master/stata_spss/stata-spss-election-survey.Rmd)
  * You can continue on to the [10 more things to do in R](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/blob/master/10morethings.md) or the [10 Excel things to do](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/blob/master/10excelthings.md)
* Identify an editorial problem - and try to solve it using R. Keep it simple - it might simply be combining data.
  * There's [an example of working with expenses data here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/blob/master/R/Rcsvexample.Rmd) - you can copy that markdown from the notebook and paste directly into your own (make sure you have the data files in your project folder)
  * There's [an example of working with gender pay gap data here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/genderpaygap/blob/master/r/downloadgenderpaygap.Rmd)
  * There's [an example of creating a filtered piece of data using `subset()` here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/blob/master/R/crimedata.Rmd)
